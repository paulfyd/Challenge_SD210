    "What was interesting about this challenge was that it was the first time we had to deal with only the raw data. \n",
    "Our strategy was pretty standard, \n",
    "We started by training simple models at the beginning. \n",
    "However, we realized from the start that it was going to be played to the nearest thousandth. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we looked at the data at the beginning, we figured the big challenge would be to deal with unbalanced data. We figured that a lot of models were going to return the 0 label too often. \n",
    "That's why we took action on our data, using oversampling on class 0, undersampling on class 1, or even both at the same time. We also tried giving different weights to the two classes with the parameter class_weights that most methods have. \n",
    "All this was not very useful in the end. We have indeed noticed that overfitting was very rare here, there shouldn't be many outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the interest was to find a model that was complex enough, given the number of data we had, and the high number of features that each one has. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we split the task in two: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Marine worked in detail on the decision trees, with testing of several criteria such as GINI or cross-entropy, with Bagging testing, performance improvement with AdaBoost, and systematic search for the best possible parameters with cross-validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Paul focused on linear models, neural networks, before focusing on decision-tree-based algorithms that uses a gradient boosting framework such as xgboost. Finally, in order to improve the most possble score, he tried the VotingClassifier and Stacking ensemble methods which gave the final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What could have been improved : \n",
    "\n",
    "- We regret to have discovered more complex methods than those seen too late in class. We focused mainly on the methods in the course, when we could have moved faster towards more complex methods like xgboost, and the use of set methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We could have perform more clever data augmentation... In fact, each data represents score A/score B/score A-B where A and B are images and could have been transformed in score B/score A/score A-B but it's unfortunately too late to do this augmentation"
